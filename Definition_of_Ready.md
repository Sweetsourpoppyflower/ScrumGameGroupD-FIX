## Overview
This Definition of Ready (DoR) outlines the criteria that must be met before a user story or task is considered ready for implementation in a sprint.

## Definition of "Ready"
A user story is considered "Ready" when:
1. It meets all applicable criteria listed above
2. It has been reviewed by at least one other team member
3. The Product Owner has approved it
4. The team agrees that they understand the requirements and can implement them within a sprint

## Checklist for Sprint Planning
During Sprint Planning, the Scrum Master should verify that each user story meets the Definition of Ready before it is accepted into the sprint. User stories that do not meet the Definition of Ready should be refined further before being included in a sprint.
